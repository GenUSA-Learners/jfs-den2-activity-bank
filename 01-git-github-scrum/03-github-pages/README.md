# Deploying to github pages

**1. Create a new repository, clone it, add an index.html, add something to the body of the HTML (could be `<h1>Your Name</h1>`, could be an `<img>` of something, you might have to google or use other README's if your unsure), push your changes to github.**

**2. In your repository on github, go to the "Settings" tab, then click the "Pages" tab on the left**

**3. Under Source, click where it says "none" and select "main", then click save.**

**4. This will produce a link to a live page just above the dropdown menu you clicked on. It may not work for a minute or two while it has the blue background color.**

**5. Refresh the page after a minute or two and you will notice that the background for the url is now green. Add this url to your README.md, then push those changes to github so you can see the live link on your repository home page.**
